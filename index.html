        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h4>I am a proud native of Shreveport, LA, where I was born and raised. Throughout my upbringing, I've always had a deep fascination for challenges that push the boundaries of conventional thinking. During my junior year of college, I found myself on a path toward obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Pre-Physical Therapy. However, I decided to pivot and embark on a career in Software Development. After conducting extensive research into various bootcamp programs, I chose Fullstack Academy as the ideal institution to prepare me for the tech industry. The program spanned six intense months, during which I not only acquired invaluable knowledge but also forged meaningful connections with brilliant individuals. This comprehensive course covered a wide spectrum of skills, encompassing Frontend, Backend, and Fullstack Web Development, with a focus on excelling in JavaScript, React, HTML5, CSS, and much more.</h4>
